# 👋 Hi, I'm Sewon Myung

I'm a second-year undergraduate student at **Georgia Tech** studying Computational Media. I build creative, intelligent systems at the intersection of **AI**, **design**, and **robotics**. I love building systems that think, feel, and move — blending real-world sensing with intelligent responses.

### 🛠 Projects I’m Exploring
- 🤖 Physical AI & multimodal robotics datasets
- 🎨 AI art critics & generative creativity tools
- 📊 Machine learning for finance and strategy
- 📐 Geometry + computer vision + real-world interaction

### 🌱 Learning Goals / Interests
- Multimodal data collection and simulation for robotics  
- Co-creative agents and AI-driven design tools  
- Geometry, computer vision, and embodied cognition  
- Bridging intuition, aesthetics, and technical depth
