# Hi, I'm Sewon Myung

I'm a second-year undergraduate student at Georgia Tech studying Computer Science. I build creative, intelligent systems at the intersection of AI, design, and robotics.

### Projects I’m Exploring
- Physical AI & multimodal robotics datasets
- AI art critics & generative creativity tools
- Geometry + computer vision + real-world interaction

### Learning Goals / Interests
- Multimodal data collection and simulation for robotics  
- Co-creative agents and AI-driven design tools  
- Geometry, computer vision, and embodied cognition  
- Bridging intuition, aesthetics, and technical depth
